# srf-meteo-api-r
This repository provides an example script for authentication, querying forecast geolocation-based weather information using the [SRF Weather API](https://developer.srgssr.ch/api-catalog/srf-weather#/. Currently, there is a *freemium* offer that allows for up to 50 requests per day for free (which usually is enough for simple data analyses or IoT applications)

## Getting consumer key and secrets
To access the API you need to [register](https://developer.srgssr.ch/user/register) and/or log in to the site. Once logged in you have to create an *app*, which you can do by accessing the *four square symbol* on the top right of the site. Add an app with your desired app name (callback URL and description can be left empty). Select the ```SRF-MeteoProductFreemium``` option; I have tried ```SRG-SSR-PUBLIC-API-V2```, however always received ```Invalid API call``` or ```Permission``` errors. Once you have saved your *app*, you can get the credentials be navigating to the credential section and pressing ```show key``` for your ```consumer key``` and ```consumer secret```. Simply paste these to the .R scripts and everything should (hopefully) work.
